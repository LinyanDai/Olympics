Our motivation for this project is to have a general view over past olympics games. 
We focus on the relationship between countries and games to figure out how a country's culture and value will influence a game
and how those cultures and values reflect back onto the game.
To ahiveve this goal, we collect relevant information about each year's game, including the moscot, the stadium, the theme song and so on.
To make our project more fun, we are also going to build a schema which documents each olympic's anecdotes for case users want to know some interesting
things about each olympics.

As shown in our ER diagram, we connect athelets,Game and Events in a tenary relationship and all athelets should all
participaite in the game as defined as an olympic atheltes. Each game has a landscape stadium and a theme song and the song and the stadium
will be a weak entity that rely on the game. Also, countries could have either participate the game as well as hold the game and when 
countries participate the game, the participate relationship will have attributes including how many golds, silver and bronze they won.
