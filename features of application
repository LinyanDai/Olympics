Our team intends to develop a website to show users related information, including countries, Olympic games, sport events, 
as well as Olympic themes and mascots. In general, our application offers a variety of useful and interesting features:
search for the host country of a specific Olympic game and the countries that participate in the game;
search for the stadiums in the country for the Olympic game, and the specific use of them;
search for the Olympic themes and mascots for a specific Olympic game; 
search for a country's performance in a specific Olympic game, such as the number of medals and the rank of the country;
search for the sports events in a specific Olympic game; 
search for the interesting stories in a specific Olympic game; 
sign in with google or facebook accounts.

Additionally, several features might be implemented in the application given enough time: 
after signing in, users can rate the Olympic themes and mascots and make comments on them;
realize the view-based access control over the dataset;
add streaming data;
trigger Bing Search.

Our initial format is show as follows:
{"_id": 1
